Hi

So this is one of my first ever whole webpage project which I think I should be able to complete lol.

Odin Flexbox Exercise

*UPDATE September 12, 2023*

Just finished the project which I think is somewhat close to what TOP wants us to achieve haha! 

For anyone looking at my work, you're free to correct my code. I think there are several clutter in my css file which are not necessary for the final output.

This was fun! hahaha! I almost quit but fortunately, I kept on going.

Good luck and have fun!
